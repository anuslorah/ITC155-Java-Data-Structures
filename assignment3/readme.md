P. 689, Ex. 5

5. Write a recursive method definition for a static method that has one parameter n of type int and that returns the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci numbers are F0 is 1, F1 is 1, F2 is 2, F3 is 3, F4 is 5, and in general
Fi+2 = Fi + Fi+1 for i = 0, 1, 2, …
Place the method in a class that has a main that tests the method.

Sample Output (for n = 10)

Which Fibonacci number do you want? 10
