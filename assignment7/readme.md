For this assignment, research Java Linked Data Structures Interview questions, select one, and submit a google doc link including:

1.Problem/Question Statement
2.Java Code Solution (the solution may be only a method rather than a running program, and if so it should at least be free of syntax errors)
3.Additional notes, if any...e.g. What is the time complexity of the solution
4.You will present the problem and solution in class to your classmates

Note: You may select a question related to any of the data structures covered in Ch 15
